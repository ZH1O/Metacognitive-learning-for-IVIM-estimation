It is a metacognitive learning strategy. In this method, in addition to calculating the fitting loss (physics-informed neural network, PINN), we formulate a metacognition loss that utilizes the outcomes of the fitted DW signal as an iterated input and constrains the discrepancy of parameter estimation between these DW signals. This self-modeling strategy compels the model (named MC-PINN) to self-reflect on the mapping from the DW signal to the parameter, achieving more accurate parameter estimation.
